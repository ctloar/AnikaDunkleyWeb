                        <p class="lead mb-5" style="text-align: justify;">
                            This Fall, I was presented with the opportunity to work on a new project with 
                            Heirloom Art. Co, a small store focused on meeting the needs of those passionate about 
                            homemaking and art. Heirloom is in the process of launching a new subscription box service
                            and reached out to a group of ExDM students to add meaningfulness to this new product. 
                            Over the course of the project my team and I dove into understanding the needs of the potential 
                            end user and used that empathy data as a segway to additional market research. 
                            My team studied and applied an assortment of observation techniques including interviewing, 
                            collage building, secret shopper and picture studies just to name a few. In the end, my team 
                            felt well equipped to make reccomendations on how to appeal to the target market to meet their 
                            expecations and began to produce social media content for the company that aligned with 
                            our recommendations. The subscription service is set to launch in March 2023.

                            In my job as an events intern for BYU Marriott, one of the biggest and most extravagent events of 
                            the year is our fall conference for the members of the National Advisory Council. My team and 
                            I prepared meals, lectures, meetings, a service project and a tailgate to be executed over the course 
                            of three days. I had the responsibility of organizing the roles and logostics of my team as well leading 
                            the efforts on planning the keynote NAC Meeting. During the event I was involved with the set-up, 
                            take-down, and managment of 10 sub events included as part of the conference. This event allowed me to 
                            gain more in depth expereience planning and executing multifaceted events an allowed me to build 
                            relationshios with many members of the BYU Marriott community.

                            I have enjoyed the opportunity to work as an intern for Ruby Jane events, 
                            a small private events company that specializes in upscale weddings. Through this 
                            position I have been involved in the preparation and exection of 8+ weddings, each 
                            with unique requests and cirsumstances. Through this position I have learned about 
                            design techniques, wedding industry standards, attention to detail, and how to create 
                            strong professional relationships with the many entities involved in a wedding. The 
                            peak of my summer wedding planning experience was applying the skills that I learned as 
                            I planned, cooridinated and executed my own wedding this August. This experience gave me 
                            the confidence of knowing that I could be involved in the events space not just as an 
                            assistant, but as a leader.

                        <p class="lead mb-5" style="text-align: justify;">
                            Winter and Spring of 2022 my experiential marketing class was assigned to design and and 
                            pitch an experiential marketing campaign for a company of our choice. My team and I were 
                            connected with Thanksgiving Point in Lehi, UT and were able to identify a specific component 
                            of their broad business that could use some additional marketing work. The outcome was a weekend 
                            long, open house style event showcasing the many facilities on the Thanksgiving Point campus 
                            that were available for event bookings. The event took an immersive approach, with each space 
                            emmulating a potential event to be held there. Guests would walk through a retirement party, 
                            a conference, a wedding, and a business meeting all in one night. The project allowed me to 
                            implement my knowledge of the Adobe Creative Cloud in a marketing context and apply my knowledge 
                            of events and marketing in a unique way.
